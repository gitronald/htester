Title: Convert HTest Results to Data.Frames
Version: 0.0.0.9000

Description: R's htest (hypothesis testing) functions (e.g. t.test, wilcox.test, cor.test, etc.)
    are essential for conducting research, but offer output in a clunky list format. These lists display well
    in the console but makes comparisons an exercise in visual gymnastics and exporting results a complicated
    affair. This package takes these htest lists as input, flattens them, and returns a data.frame where comparisons
    can quickly be made and results can easily be exported.
Depends:
    R (>= 3.2.3)
